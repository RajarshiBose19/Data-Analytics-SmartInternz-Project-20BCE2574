Welcome to the Data Analytics SmartInternz project, "A Comprehensive Analysis Of The IT Sector Salaries And Roles." This project aims to provide a detailed and insightful examination of salary trends and job roles within the Information Technology (IT) sector. By leveraging Tableau for data analytics and visualization, we intend to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing salaries and the distribution of job roles in this rapidly evolving industry. Additionally, we have created a dedicated website to showcase the project's findings and interactive Tableau visualizations.

## Project Overview

The IT sector is known for its dynamic nature and significant impact on the global economy. Understanding the various aspects of this domain, such as salary trends and roles, can help both job seekers and employers make informed decisions. This Tableau-based project explores a diverse dataset encompassing salary information and job role details from multiple IT companies and professionals.

## Objectives

- **Salary Analysis**: Utilize Tableau's powerful data analysis capabilities to explore salary data, identify patterns, trends, and distributions within the IT sector. Discover factors that contribute to variations in salaries, such as experience, location, education, and job level.

- **Job Role Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of job roles across different IT companies and sectors. Examine the most common roles and their prevalence in the industry.

- **Identify Skill Demands**: Determine the most sought-after skills and qualifications in the IT job market, providing valuable insights for aspiring professionals.

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Create interactive and visually appealing dashboards in Tableau to present findings effectively and facilitate easy exploration of data.

- **Dedicated Website**: Develop a dedicated website to showcase the project's results, visualizations, and insights, making it accessible to a broader audience.

## Technologies Used

The project primarily relies on Tableau Desktop to perform data analysis and create visualizations. Tableau's drag-and-drop interface and interactive features empower us to create insightful dashboards with ease. Additionally, we use web development technologies to build the dedicated project website, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

As this project includes a dedicated website, the repository structure is as follows:

- `data`: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis. Due to privacy concerns, we have anonymized the data while preserving its integrity.

- `tableau_workbooks`: The Tableau workbooks directory contains the Tableau files (`*.twbx`) that showcase various visualizations and dashboards.

- `website`: This directory contains the web development files for the dedicated project website, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- `docs`: This directory contains supplementary documents, such as project reports or presentation slides.

## Getting Started

To explore the project's visualizations and insights, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
